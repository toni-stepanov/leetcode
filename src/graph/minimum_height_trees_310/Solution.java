310. Minimum Height Trees
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/

For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root.
 The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with
 minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a
 function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

Format
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the
number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are
undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example 1:

Given n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3
return [1]

Example 2:

Given n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

     0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5
return [3, 4]

Hint:

How many MHTs can a graph have at most?
Note:

(1) According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which
 any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph
 without simple cycles is a tree.”

(2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between
the root and a leaf.
