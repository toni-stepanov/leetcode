/**
 * 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined
 * between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * <p>

 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
 * Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a
 * descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
