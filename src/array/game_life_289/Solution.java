/**
 * 289. Game of Life
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/
 * <p>
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life,
 * is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 * <p>
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0).
 * Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using
 * the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
 * <p>
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You
 * cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 * In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite,
 * which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would
 * you address these problems?
 * Credits:
 * Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
