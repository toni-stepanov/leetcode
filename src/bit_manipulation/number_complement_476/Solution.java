476. Number Complement
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/#/description

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1
(no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

//    To find complement of num = 5 which is 101 in binary.
//    First ~num gives ...11111010 but we only care about the rightmost 3 bits.
//    Then to erase the 1s before 010 we can add 1000
    int findComplement(int num) {
        // 5 -> 0101 => Integer.highestOneBit(num) == 0100;
        // mask:   highestOneBit << 1   =>   0100 << 1   =>   1000
        // mask "-1":    1000 - 1  == 0111
        int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;

        // ~num   =>   5 is 0101  =>   ~5 is 1010, but we need only last 3 bits
        // ~num & mask    =>    1010 & 0111 == 0010    =>   res = 2
        return ~num & mask;
    }

    // pretty the same
//    ~5 = 11111111111111111111111111111010
//            Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(num)) = 29
//            -1 = 11111111111111111111111111111111
//    So we shift the ones of (-1) to the right 29 times adding a zero
//-1 >>> 29 = 00000000000000000000000000000111
//    then we and that with the ~5:
//            00000000000000000000000000000010

        return num ^ (-1 >>> Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(num));
