376. Wiggle Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/

A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive
 numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists)
 may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially
 a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3)
 are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle
 sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its
  last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence.
 A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original
  sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Examples:
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
