357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-numbers-with-unique-digits/

Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

Example:
Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100,
excluding [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])

    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits1(int n) {
        if(n == 0) return 1;
        if (n>10) n = 10;
        int sum = 10;
        for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
            int mul = 9;
            for(int j=0; j<=i; j++) {
                mul *= 9-j;
            }
            sum += mul;

     https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/48332/java-o-1-with-explanation
     My explanation:
     n==0 -> 1
     n==1 -> (0 <= x < 10) -> 10
     n==2 -> (0 <= x < 10) + (10 <= x < 100) -> 10 + 9*9
     why 9*9:
      1st digit - can be [1..9] = 9, because of it can`t be 0.
      2nd digit - can be [0..9] excluding 1st => 9
     n==3 -> (0 <= x < 10) + (10 <= x < 100) + (100 <= x < 1000) -> 10 + 9*9 + 9*9*8
     why 9*9*8:
      1st digit - can be [1..9] = 9, because of it can`t be 0.
      2nd digit - can be [0..9] excluding 1st => 9
      3nd digit - can be [0..9] excluding 1st & 2nd => 8
     ...
     ...
     n==10 -> (0 <= x < 10) + (10 <= x < 100) ... (10^9 <= x < 10^10)
     (10^9 <= x < 10^10) => 9*9*8.....*2*1

     n==11 -> (0 <= x < 10) + (10 <= x < 100) ... (10^10 <= x < 10^11)
     (10^10 <= x < 10^11) => 9*9*8.....*2*1*0 = 0
     So the max number of unique numbers is the same like n==10 even n>10.
     This is obvious, because such numbers has more than 10 digits,
     thus some digit used at least twice.
