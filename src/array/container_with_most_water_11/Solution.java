/**
 11. Container With Most Water
 https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

 Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an,
 where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical
 lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai)
 and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container,
 such that the container contains the most water.

 Note: You may not slant the container.
